# Day 6: Wait For It

In the story, you arrive at a small island where a large pile of sand is said to be located, but all you find is water.
You notice a poster advertising boat races with a grand prize trip to Desert Island, which you deduce is the source of
the sand. You enter the race, which involves toy boats that move based on how long you charge them by holding down a
button. The boats are small with a big button on top, and the race is won by traveling the farthest within a fixed time.
You're given a sheet listing the time allowed for each race and the best distance ever recorded. To win, you must exceed
the current record. The boats start with zero speed, and their speed increases the longer you hold the button at the
start. However, holding the button consumes race time. You calculate the number of ways to beat the record in each race.
Later, you realize the race times and distances are actually for a single, much longer race due to a printing error, and
you must determine how many ways to win this one race.
