# Day 9: Mirage Maintenance

In the midst of a sandstorm, a traveler arrives at an oasis on a camel, following a ghost's map. As the storm clears, a
metal floating island is revealed, which is the source of parts needed to fix sand machines. A hang glider, half-buried
in the sand, offers a potential way to reach the island once the sun heats the sand enough for flight. While waiting for
dawn, the traveler decides to take ecological readings of the oasis using an Oasis And Sand Instability Sensor (OASIS).
The device generates a report with various values and their changes over time. The traveler is tasked with predicting
the next value for each set of data to help protect the oasis's delicate ecosystem. The story concludes with the
traveler successfully extrapolating the necessary values and hints at the possibility of also extrapolating previous
values.
