# Day 10: Pipe Maze

In a fantastical setting, the protagonist arrives at a floating metal island after a journey on a hang glider. The
island is unexpectedly chilly, and the hang glider is abandoned due to the lack of thermal air currents. The environment
is strikingly unusual, with flora and fauna composed entirely of metal. Amidst the metallic nature, the protagonist
spots a peculiar metallic creature darting into a large pipe.

The island's terrain is a labyrinth of pipes that blend seamlessly with the metallic ground, making it difficult to
distinguish the pipes from the surface. Signposts pointing to hot springs suggest a direction to find someone who might
know about desert-machine parts. The pipes form a complex grid, and the protagonist sketches the visible pipes to track
the creature, which is believed to be inside a continuous loop of pipes.

The protagonist's goal is to get ahead of the creature by finding the farthest point in the loop from the starting
position, based on the number of steps along the loop. The challenge is complicated by the presence of many disconnected
pipes that do not form part of the main loop. The protagonist also considers the possibility of the creature's nest
being within the area enclosed by the loop, prompting a calculation of the number of tiles within the loop to determine
if there is time to search for the nest.
