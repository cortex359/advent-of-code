# Day 12: Hot Springs

Once upon a time in a magical village, the elves were preparing for Christmas. The village was covered in a thick
blanket of snow, and the air was filled with the sound of laughter and joy. The elves were busy in their workshop,
crafting toys and gifts for children all around the world.

Amidst the festive atmosphere, there was a sense of urgency. The hot springs, which were essential for heating the
forges and keeping the workshop operational, had suddenly stopped flowing. The head elf, Jingle, called for a meeting to
address the issue.

"Dear friends," Jingle announced, "the hot springs have run cold, and without them, we cannot continue our work. We need
to repair the damaged springs and restore them to their former glory."

The elves gathered around, eager to help. They knew that the condition records of the springs were damaged, making it
difficult to identify which ones were operational and which ones were damaged. However, they were determined to overcome
this challenge and save Christmas.

As they ventured into the field where the springs were located, they saw rows of springs, some operational (`.`), some
damaged (`#`), and some with unknown conditions (`?`). The elves knew that they had to figure out how many different
arrangements of operational and broken springs fit the given criteria in each row to repair the damaged records.

With their keen eyes and nimble minds, the elves set out to analyze each row, counting all the different arrangements of
operational and broken springs that met the given criteria. They meticulously worked through each row, carefully
considering the possible combinations.

Despite the initial complexity, the elves persevered, and soon they had calculated the sum of all the counts. Their hard
work and determination paid off, and they successfully determined the total number of arrangements.

As the sun set over the magical village, the elves celebrated their achievement. The hot springs were repaired, and the
workshop was once again filled with warmth and light. Christmas was saved, thanks to the ingenuity and resourcefulness
of the elves.

And so, the joyous preparations for Christmas continued, with the elves working tirelessly to ensure that every child's
gift would be ready in time. The spirit of Christmas, filled with hope and magic, shone brightly in the hearts of the
elves as they embraced the true meaning of the holiday season.
