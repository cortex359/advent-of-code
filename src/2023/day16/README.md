In the heart of a mountain, within a vast cave, the story unfolds around a Lava Production Facility. The cave's natural walls and floors have replaced the steel structure of the facility, creating an atmosphere of ancient and rugged beauty. At the center of this subterranean landscape, a beam of light emerges from the cavern wall, its energy directed into a complex contraption.

This contraption is a flat, two-dimensional grid, a mosaic of mirrors, splitters, and empty spaces. The mirrors are angled to reflect the light beam, changing its direction, while the splitters can either allow the beam to pass through or split it into two separate paths. The intricate arrangement of these elements on the grid creates a dance of light and shadow, as the beam bounces and divides across the surface.

The grid itself is a marvel of precision and complexity, with the light beam's path visibly altering as it interacts with the various components. The goal of this elaborate setup is to convert the light into heat, melting the rock within the cavern to produce lava. However, the light is not energizing enough tiles to achieve this, prompting a need to analyze and adjust the contraption to save Christmas.
