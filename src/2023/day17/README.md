In the story, elves are working in a factory city on Gear Island, where they are filling large, top-heavy crucibles with lava to transport to a machine parts factory. The crucibles are on wheels and are difficult to steer at high speeds, especially in a straight line. The elves have a map that calculates heat loss for each city block, and they must find the best route to minimize this heat loss while also not going straight for too long due to the steering difficulty. The starting point is a lava pool, and the destination is the factory, both located at opposite corners of the map. The elves must navigate the crucible through the city, making sure to turn before reaching the limit of three consecutive blocks in one direction.
