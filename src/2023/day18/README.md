Once upon a time in the North Pole, the Elves were working hard to create a large lagoon to store a large supply of lava for the machine parts factory. However, they made a mistake in the dig plan, swapping the color and instruction parameters. The digger started in a 1 meter cube hole in the ground and dug the specified number of meters up, down, left, or right, clearing full 1 meter cubes as they went. The directions were given as seen from above, and each trench was also listed with the color that the edge of the trench should be painted as an RGB hexadecimal color code.

The Elves were concerned that the lagoon wouldn't be large enough, so they asked for help to extract the correct instructions from the hexadecimal codes. The goal was to determine how many cubic meters of lava the lagoon could hold if they followed the new dig plan.

After converting the hexadecimal color codes into the correct instructions, the lagoon could hold an impressive *952408144115* cubic meters of lava.

The North Pole was now ready for the festive season, with a large lagoon to store the necessary lava for the machine parts factory.
