# Day 19: Aplenty

In the story, the Christmas elves on Gear Island are dealing with a massive accumulation of machine parts that need to
be sorted. The parts are rated based on four categories: how cool they look, their musicality, aerodynamics, and
shininess. The elves have developed a system of workflows to process these parts, with each workflow consisting of a
series of rules that determine whether a part should be accepted or rejected. The rules are based on the ratings of the
parts and direct them to different workflows or to their final accepted or rejected status. The elves are struggling to
keep up with the influx of parts and request assistance in sorting them. The story includes a hang glider, a heap of
machine parts, and elves organizing the chaos with their systematic approach.
