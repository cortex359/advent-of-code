# Day 22: Sand Slabs

In the story, Christmas elves are tasked with the critical mission of filtering water for Snow Island using sand that
has fallen in the form of large compacted bricks. These bricks have accumulated into a towering stack on Island Island.
To utilize the sand for water filtration, some bricks must be disintegrated into loose sand without causing the stack to
collapse, which would be hazardous.

The elves have a snapshot of the bricks' positions while they were still airborne, which is essential for determining
which bricks can be safely disintegrated. The bricks are magically stabilized, preventing rotation, and they cannot
occupy the same space, so a falling brick will rest upon the first brick it encounters.

The story involves the elves figuring out which bricks can be disintegrated without affecting the stability of the
others. They must consider the entire structure, as removing one brick could cause others to fall if not carefully
chosen. The goal is to disintegrate bricks in a way that prevents any additional bricks from falling, ensuring the
safety and efficiency of the water filtration process.
